# fMRI-Analysis-Tool
The fMRI Analysis Tool is a collection of Matlab scripts and functions written to analyze fMRI data. The package includes tools for comparing voxels or ROIs, removing background noise, and statistical testing. Though it was designed for rat brain imaging, its use can easily be extended to other applications.
